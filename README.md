# Frog Rain

Frog Rain is an opinionated starter kit for Magnolia CMS frontend development. It contains everything necessary to kickstart a Magnolia sitei project with no Java coding required.

## What is included
* Gulp for building the project
* Babel for transpiling the modern ES2015 language to ES5 compatible JavaScript
* SASS, the excellent CSS preprocessor
* PostCSS for autoprefixing properties (no need to worry about -o, -webkit, -moz, etc)
* Vagrant for quickly creating a local Magnolia development server
* JSCS for enforcing code style conventions
* PPR.js for writing component specific JavaScript
* RequireJS for dynamically loading JS dependencies
* Karma, Mocha and Chai for tests (WIP)

## What is not included / out of scope
* Grid library
* UI toolkit such as Bootstrap or Foundation
* Any external fonts or icon kits
* MTE (Magnolia Templating Essentials)
* YAML extends (will be natively supported in Magnolia 5.5.1 or 5.5.2)
